This is the Supplementary Material for the manuscript entitled \emph{How
to be civil about political loss -- The importance of good loser
messages}.

We pre-registered Study 2 and Study 3 at aspredicted.org.

When not otherwise stated, we followed the pre-registration.

We deviated from it in the following ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Exclusion criteria. While we registered to exclude individuals that
  raced through the survey in Study 2, we have since then learned that
  exclusion based on such a post-treatment variable can bias the
  obtained effects (Montgomery et al, 2018). Accordingly, we present the
  analysis on the full sample in the main text. The analysis using the
  reduced sample can be found in this Appendix (see section
  @ref(reduced-sample) ).
\item
  For study 2, we pre-registered a hypothesis that predicts an
  interaction between the good loser norm and the good loser message.
  Since there is little variance on the good-loser norm variable, this
  analysis is less insightful than we had anticipated. We therefore do
  not present this analysis in the main text but in the Appendix (see
  section @ref(norm-mod) ).
\item
  For study 3, we pre-registered that we would use two indicators of
  fairness perceptions. To keep the dependent variable comparable across
  studies we have later on decided to only present the analysis with the
  item: `How fair was the decision-making procedure?' for all three
  studies. The analysis using the additional item `How reasonable do you
  think the decision was?' is included in the robustness check analysis
  in the paper (Table 2).
\item
  For study 3, we missed to specify that there are two good loser
  message like in study 2 (for which we have the same expectations): A
  generic and a specific good loser message.
\item
  While we use the wording good loser prime in the pre-registration, we
  have later decided to use good loser message in the manuscript.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{(PART) STUDY I}\label{part-study-i}}

The experiment for Study I was fielded in Sweden in the fall of 2017 and
spring of 2018 as an add-on to the fifth wave of the European Values
Survey (EVS, PI Susanne Wallman Lund√•sen). EVS is based on a probability
sample of the Swedish population age 18 or older (n = 1194). Interviews
were face-to-face. The fieldwork organization was IPSOS, Sweden. For a
detailed documentation we refer to
\url{https://europeanvaluesstudy.eu/methodology-data-documentation/}.
Study 1 was one of three experiments included in a paper and pencil
leave behind. The return rate of the questionnaire was 85\% (n =1019).

The experiment for Study II was fielded in Norway during the spring and
fall of 2017 during the 9th and 10th waves of
\href{https://www.uib.no/medborger}{Norwegian Citizen Panel}. This is a
research-purpose internet panel with over 6000 active participants. It
is based on a probability sample of the general Norwegian population
above the age of 18 drawn from the Norwegian National Registry. The
survey is based on a online questionnaire with postal recruitment. Panel
members complete a questionnaire three times a year of 15 minutes each.
The survey panel is a core component of The Digital Social Science Core
Facilities (DIGSSCORE), and was established in 2013 as a collaboration
between several departments at the Faculty of Social Sciences at the
University of Bergen and NORCE -- Norwegian Research Centre. We refer to
the \href{Data/ncp-wave13-documentation.pdf}{documentation report} for
further details on technical aspects of the survey, panel recruitment,
response rates of the 13th wave, and representativeness. For details
about the data collected in this project and the survey panel at large,
we refer to the \href{Data/ncp-wave13-codebook.pdf}{codebook for the
Waves 1-13}.

1 Intro to all respondents: Imagine that your municipality is about to
decide whether begging on the streets should be banned or allowed within
the municipal borders in the future. This is a controversial decision:
Some inhabitants and politicians strongly support the ban, while other
inhabitants and politicians are equally strongly against such a ban on
begging. Some parties propose a ban on begging. The decision will be
made in the municipal council, and follows the normal decision-making
procedure. The proposal is first debated in the council, where all
members are welcome to express their position and their arguments. The
debate is public, and journalists are present to report on the debate.
In the end, the politicians vote on the proposal.

\chapter{(PART) STUDY III}\label{part-study-iii}}

The third study was also run online on a representative sample of adult
Norwegians. We conducted a conjoint experiment with a rating assignment
embedded in the 2018 fall wave of the Norwegian Citizen Panel.

The conjoint design allows us to explore scope conditions of findings.
The advantage of conjoint designs, a method increasingly used in
experimental political science research (Leeper, Hobolt, and Tilley
\protect\hyperlink{ref-leeper2020measuring}{2020}), is the possibility
to include a large number of experimental treatments and estimate their
effects simultaneously (Hainmueller, Hopkins, and Yamamoto
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hainmueller2014causal}{2014}). The stimulus
material for each respondent consists of randomly combined levels of the
given features, resulting in sufficient observations for each feature
while only a small share of the possible combinations is actually shown
to participants. This enables us to include context variables into our
design and to test our relationships of interest across a range of other
factors that could potentially interfere with the treatment. As a result
we gain insights into generalizability and robustness of our findings.
Our conjoint design is presented as a text vignette with rating outcome
measures like in studies 1 and 2. For similar applications in conjoint
designs, see for example Huff and Kertzer
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-huff2018public}{2018}).
