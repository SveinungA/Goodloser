We pre-registered Study 2 and Study 3 at aspredicted.org. When not otherwise stated, we followed the pre-registration. We deviated from it in the following ways: Exclusion criteria. While we registered to exclude individuals that raced through the survey in Study 2, we have since then learned that exclusion based on such a post-treatment variable can bias the obtained effects (Montgomery et al, 2018). Accordingly, we present the analysis on the full sample in the main text. The analysis using the reduced sample can be found in this Appendix (see section 7.4 ). For study 2, we pre-registered a hypothesis that predicts an interaction between the good loser norm and the good loser message. Since there is little variance on the good-loser norm variable, this analysis is less insightful than we had anticipated. We therefore do not present this analysis in the main text but in the Appendix (see section ?? ). For study 3, we pre-registered that we would use two indicators of fairness perceptions. To keep the dependent variable comparable across studies we have later on decided to only present the analysis with the item: ‘How fair was the decision-making procedure?’ for all three studies. The analysis using the additional item ‘How reasonable do you think the decision was?’ is included in the robustness check analysis in the paper (Table 2). For study 3, we missed to specify that there are two good loser message like in study 2 (for which we have the same expectations): A generic and a specific good loser message. While we use the wording good loser prime in the pre-registration, we have later decided to use good loser message in the manuscript. S.I. 2 (PART) STUDY I The experiment for Study I was fielded in Sweden in the fall of 2017 and spring of 2018 as an add-on to the fifth wave of the European Values Survey (EVS, PI Susanne Wallman Lundåsen). EVS is based on a probability sample of the Swedish population age 18 or older (n = 1194). Interviews were face-to-face. The fieldwork organization was IPSOS, Sweden. For a detailed documentation we refer to https://europeanvaluesstudy.eu/methodology-data-documentation/. Study 1 was one of three experiments included in a paper and pencil leave behind. The return rate of the questionnaire was 85% (n =1019). S.I. 3 Pre-treatment measures and experimental vignette The statistics are displayed for the respondents of interest in this study, which is the respondents who end up with observing an unfavorable decision outcome in the experiment. 3.1 Pre-treatment measures 3.1.1 Ban on begging - opinion (#tab:1031_pre_begging)What is your opinion on a ban on begging in your municipality?

Imagine that your municipality is about to decide whether begging on the streets should be banned or allowed within the municipal borders. The decision can be made in different ways: One option is that the local political representatives make the decision. Another option is that the citizens of the municipality decide through a referendum. Please image how you would react if this scenario occurred in your municipality: After a debate in the media, the local political representatives decide to ban begging in the municipality.

This is a research-purpose internet panel with over 6000 active participants. It is based on a probability sample of the general Norwegian population above the age of 18 drawn from the Norwegian National Registry. The survey is based on a online questionnaire with postal recruitment. Panel members complete a questionnaire three times a year of 15 minutes each. The survey panel is a core component of The Digital Social Science Core Facilities (DIGSSCORE), and was established in 2013 as a collaboration between several departments at the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Bergen and NORCE – Norwegian Research Centre. We refer to the documentation report for further details on technical aspects of the survey, panel recruitment, response rates of the 13th wave, and representativeness. For details about the data collected in this project and the survey panel at large, we refer to the codebook for the Waves 1-13.

This is a controversial decision: Some inhabitants and politicians strongly support the ban, while other inhabitants and politicians are equally strongly against such a ban on begging. Some parties propose a ban on begging. The decision will be made in the municipal council, and follows the normal decision-making procedure. The proposal is first debated in the council, where all members are welcome to express their position and their arguments. The debate is public, and journalists are present to report on the debate. In the end, the politicians vote on the proposal. 2 Video voice over text (video was subtitled). 6.3 Post-measures 6.3.1 Fairness (#tab:2031_exp_post1)Fairness: What do you think about the way the decision was made?

We conducted a conjoint experiment with a rating assignment embedded in the 2018 fall wave of the Norwegian Citizen Panel. The conjoint design allows us to explore scope conditions of findings. The advantage of conjoint designs, a method increasingly used in experimental political science research (Leeper, Hobolt, and Tilley 2020), is the possibility to include a large number of experimental treatments and estimate their effects simultaneously (Hainmueller, Hopkins, and Yamamoto 2014). The stimulus material for each respondent consists of randomly combined levels of the given features, resulting in sufficient observations for each feature while only a small share of the possible combinations is actually shown to participants. This enables us to include context variables into our design and to test our relationships of interest across a range of other factors that could potentially interfere with the treatment. As a result we gain insights into generalizability and robustness of our findings. Our conjoint design is presented as a text vignette with rating outcome measures like in studies 1 and 2. For similar applications in conjoint designs, see for example Huff and Kertzer (2018).

The proposal will initially be debated by the municipal council where all the members will have the opportunity to express their opinions and arguments regarding the issue.

In the end, the politicians will vote on the issue. {Outcome} {[Winning margin} {Winner gloating} {Messenger and prime} 9.3 Post treatment measures Please note that the the respondents were randomly assigned to either a worded answer scale, or a numbered answer scale.
