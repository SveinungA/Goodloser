# Preface

This is the Supplementary Material for the manuscript entitled *How to be civil about political loss 
– The importance of good loser messages*. 
<!-- by [Peter Esaiasson](https://www.gu.se/omuniversitetet/personal/?userId=xesape), [Hannah Werner](http://www.uva.nl/profiel/w/e/h.i.werner/h.i.werner.html), and [Sveinung Arnesen](http://frosty-bose-c7f82c.netlify.com/).  -->

We pre-registered [Study 2](http://aspredicted.org/blind.php?x=a84rk7) and [Study 3](http://aspredicted.org/blind.php?x=t4ss9j) at aspredicted.org.
 
When not otherwise stated, we followed the pre-registration. 

We deviated from it in the following ways: 

1.	Exclusion criteria. 
While we registered to exclude individuals that raced through the survey in Study 2, we have since then learned that exclusion based on such a post-treatment variable can bias the obtained effects (Montgomery et al, 2018). 
Accordingly, we present the analysis on the full sample in the main text. 
The analysis using the reduced sample can be found in this Appendix (see section \@ref(reduced-sample) ). 

2.	For study 2, we pre-registered a hypothesis that predicts an interaction between the good loser norm and the good loser message.
Since there is little variance on the good-loser norm variable, this analysis is less insightful than we had anticipated. 
We therefore do not present this analysis in the main text but in the Appendix (see section \@ref(norm-mod) ). 

3.	For study 3, we pre-registered that we would use two indicators of fairness perceptions. 
To keep the dependent variable comparable across studies we have later on decided to only present the analysis with the item:
'How fair was the decision-making procedure?' for all three studies. 
The analysis using the additional item 'How reasonable do you think the decision was?' is included in the robustness check analysis in the paper (Table 2). 

4.	For study 3, we missed to specify that there are two good loser message like in study 2 (for which we have the same expectations):
A generic and a specific good loser message.

5.	While we use the wording good loser prime in the pre-registration, we have later decided to use good loser message in the manuscript.

<!-- The study has been presented at the Barcelona-Gothenburg-Bergen workshop on Experiments in Political Science in 2018, and at the 2019 Conference of the Midwestern Political Science Association in Chicago, USA. -->
