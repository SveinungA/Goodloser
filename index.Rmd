# Preface

This is the Supplementary Material for the manuscript entitled *How to be civil about political loss 
– The importance of good loser messages*. 
<!-- by [Peter Esaiasson](https://www.gu.se/omuniversitetet/personal/?userId=xesape), [Hannah Werner](http://www.uva.nl/profiel/w/e/h.i.werner/h.i.werner.html), and [Sveinung Arnesen](http://frosty-bose-c7f82c.netlify.com/).  -->
The study comprises three survey embedded experiments; one video vignette experiment in Norway, one text vignette experiment in Sweden, and one conjoint experiment in Norway. 

The experiment for Study I was fielded in Sweden in the fall of 2017 and spring of 2018 as an add-on to the fifth wave of the European Values Survey (EVS, PI Susanne Wallman Lundåsen). EVS is based on a probability sample of the Swedish population age 18 or older (n = 1194). Interviews were face-to-face. The fieldwork organization was IPSOS, Sweden. For a detailed documentation we refer to https://europeanvaluesstudy.eu/methodology-data-documentation/. Study 1 was one of three experiments included in a paper and pencil leave behind. The return rate of the questionnaire was 85% (n =1019).

The experiment for Study II was fielded in Norway during the spring and fall of 2017 during the 9th and 10th waves of [Norwegian Citizen Panel](https://www.uib.no/medborger). This is a research-purpose internet panel with over 6000 active participants. It is based on a probability sample of the general Norwegian population above the age of 18 drawn from the Norwegian National Registry. The survey is based on a online questionnaire with postal recruitment. Panel members complete a questionnaire three times a year of 15 minutes each. The survey panel is a core component of The Digital Social Science Core Facilities (DIGSSCORE), and  was established in 2013 as a collaboration between several departments at the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Bergen and NORCE -- Norwegian Research Centre. We refer to the [documentation report](Data/ncp-wave13-documentation.pdf) for further details on technical aspects of the survey, panel recruitment, response rates of the 13th wave, and representativeness. For details about the data collected in this project and the survey panel at large, we refer to the [codebook for the Waves 1-13](Data/ncp-wave13-codebook.pdf).

The experiments for Study III was also fielded in Norway, this time during the fall of 2018 in the 13th panel wave.
<!-- The study has been presented at the Barcelona-Gothenburg-Bergen workshop on Experiments in Political Science in 2018, and at the 2019 Conference of the Midwestern Political Science Association in Chicago, USA. -->
