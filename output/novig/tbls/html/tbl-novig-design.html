<sup>1</sup> Intro to all respondents: Imagine that your municipality is about to decide whether begging on the streets should be banned or allowed within the municipal borders in the future. This is a controversial decision: Some inhabitants and politicians strongly support the ban, while other inhabitants and politicians are equally strongly against such a ban on begging. Some parties propose a ban on begging. The decision will be made in the municipal council, and follows the normal decision-making procedure. The proposal is  first debated in the council, where all members are welcome to express their position and their arguments. The debate is public, and journalists are present to report on the debate. In the end, the politicians vote on the proposal.</td></tr>
